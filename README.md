# Webbitz-Test

in order to run the code : 
we must install:
1. jdk. java
2. eclipse
3. selenium-java
4. chromedriver
5. git


test scenario in BDD: User successfully selects a video to watch.

GIVEN user is on webbitz Login page
WHEN user enters the email
AND user enters the password
AND user click log in
THEN user successfully enterred to the page
THEN user selected the video he wants(the first one).



Note:
this is a java code, I have worked 8 months as javascript developer, but I don't know selenium with javascript, and I don't have enough time.
I'm going to learn selenium with javascript in few days.
